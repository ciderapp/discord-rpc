# examples

Here, you can find some example on how to use the library, `oauth` is the one that use scopes, the default one is all the scope that you can use, `status` is just a simple status

For `oauth`, `clientSecret` is REQUIRED and you will need to have one redirect url defined in the `OAuth2` tab, under `Redirects` section. You can just put in `http://localhost/` and it will works.
